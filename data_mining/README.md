# What I want
I want to not only show the similar flags and their name, I would really like to be able to point users to more information about the flag. The best way I know how to do that (and the way I most commonly do it), is to use Wikipedia. For this reason, I'd like to scrape as much flag info as possible off of wikipedia (TODO(bjafek) check their rules regarding this, but I think it's ok).  
This is a little bit better than even the incredible FOTW database, because it doesn't look like they include external links to find out more information about their flags (TODO(bjafek) is this true?).

# How I'm going to do that
~For now I'm just gonna make a couple of selenium scripts for individual wikipedia compilation pages, and see how far that gets me.~
wikimedia-downloader with a couple extra filters seems like it's going to be great.
