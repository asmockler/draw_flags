# Wikimedia Downloader
I copied this from: https://github.com/ryanrudes/wikimedia-downloader, thanks @ryanrudes
(I think the license allows me to do this since I included the LICENCE file too. If I get this working I'll figure out a better way to credit him).

This is a fast, asynchronous script that recursively downloads all images under the specified Wikimedia categories.

## Installation
```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
